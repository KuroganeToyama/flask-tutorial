# Project Description <br>
This is a project to practice using Flask to create a simple blogsite <br>
with user authentication and blog creation features, as well as learning the basics <br>
of manipulating SQLite databases. <br>
That aside, this is just me following the tutorials on the official Flask documentation. <br>
It's less about building a project and more about learning the basics.
